### Overview

For the past six years, I have worked as a graphic designer in many environments and have been exposed to many more. Much to my dismay, I find the vast majority of graphic designers woefully unequipped to develop designs in industry standard software like Adobe Illustrator. Instead, create their designs work in Adobe Photoshop, an application made for advanced photo editing, not graphic design. I found that the major reason these designers don’t use Adobe Illustrator is that they don’t realize the power of the software and are afraid to use the pen tool. 
Files in Adobe Illustrator are more scalable, take up less hard-drive space, and are easier to edit later on. Not only is Adobe Illustrator based on vector math, meaning pixilation is a thing of the past, but Illustrator makes layers obsolete, making artwork easier to edit after the fact. This small compilation of standard operating procedures will help any designer or ad agency work more efficiently through better graphic development process and standardization.
